# world_seekers_api
### Prerequisites
#### node
#### npm
#### a mysql local server 
#### a mysql manager
### This API has 3 steps, at least up to now
#### 1) First clone the repository
#### 2) Then on the root folder make an npm install, in order to get all the dependancies
#### 3) Start a mysql server an run the sql script in the /app/db folder
#### 4) get back to the console and run an npm start. Obviously this will start the sever on port 8080
